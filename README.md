## 🌟 Project Overview

**Empathetic Echoes** is an advanced, emotion-aware psychiatric chatbot designed to simulate empathetic conversations using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model. It generates responses that reflect **emotional intelligence**, **contextual memory**, and **compassionate tone**, aiming to emulate therapist-like interactions.

This project leverages the [Hugging Face Empathetic Dialogues](https://huggingface.co/datasets/empathetic_dialogues) dataset (~25,000 real-world conversations) to train a language model that:
- Detects emotional context
- Maintains multi-turn dialogue history
- Generates supportive and human-like replies
